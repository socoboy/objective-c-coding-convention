## Code Organization

Use `#pragma mark -` to categorize methods in functional groupings and protocol/delegate implementations following this general structure.

```objc
#pragma mark - Lifecycle

- (instancetype)init {}
- (void)dealloc {}
- (void)viewDidLoad {}
- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {}
- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {}

#pragma mark - Custom Accessors

- (void)setCustomProperty:(id)value {}
- (id)customProperty {}

#pragma mark - IBActions

- (IBAction)submitData:(id)sender {}

#pragma mark - Public

- (void)publicMethod {}

#pragma mark - Private

- (void)privateMethod {}

#pragma mark - Protocol conformance
#pragma mark - UITextFieldDelegate
#pragma mark - UITableViewDataSource
#pragma mark - UITableViewDelegate

#pragma mark - NSCopying

- (id)copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone {}

#pragma mark - NSObject

- (NSString *)description {}
```

## Spacing

* Indent using 2 spaces (this conserves space in print and makes line wrapping less likely). Never indent with tabs. Be sure to set this preference in Xcode.
* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.

**Preferred:**
```objc
if (user.isHappy) {
  //Do something
} else {
  //Do something else
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```objc
if (user.isHappy)
{
    //Do something
}
else {
    //Do something else
}
```

* There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but often there should probably be new methods.
* Prefer using auto-synthesis. But if necessary, `@synthesize` and `@dynamic` should each be declared on new lines in the implementation.
* Colon-aligning method invocation should often be avoided.  There are cases where a method signature may have >= 3 colons and colon-aligning makes the code more readable. Please do **NOT** however colon align methods containing blocks because Xcode's indenting makes it illegible.

**Preferred:**

```objc
// blocks are easily readable
[UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^{
  // something
} completion:^(BOOL finished) {
  // something
}];
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
// colon-aligning makes the block indentation hard to read
[UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                 animations:^{
                     // something
                 }
                 completion:^(BOOL finished) {
                     // something
                 }];
```

## Dot Notation Syntax

Dot notation is RECOMMENDED over bracket notation for getting and setting properties.

**For example:**
```objc
view.backgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
```

**Not:**
```objc
[view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor orangeColor]];
UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate;
```

## Comments

When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Block comments should generally be avoided, as code should be as self-documenting as possible, with only the need for intermittent, few-line explanations. *Exception: This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.*

## Naming

Apple naming conventions should be adhered to wherever possible, especially those related to [memory management rules](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html) ([NARC](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2865194/340508)).

Long, descriptive method and variable names are good.

**Preferred:**

```objc
UIButton *settingsButton;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
UIButton *setBut;
```

A three letter prefix should always be used for class names and constants, however may be omitted for Core Data entity names. For any official raywenderlich.com books, starter kits, or tutorials, the prefix 'RWT' should be used.

Constants should be camel-case with all words capitalized and prefixed by the related class name for clarity.

**Preferred:**

```objc
static NSTimeInterval const RWTTutorialViewControllerNavigationFadeAnimationDuration = 0.3;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
static NSTimeInterval const fadetime = 1.7;
```

Properties should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase. Use auto-synthesis for properties rather than manual @synthesize statements unless you have good reason.

**Preferred:**

```objc
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *descriptiveVariableName;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
id varnm;
```

### Underscores

When using properties, instance variables should always be accessed and mutated using `self.`. This means that all properties will be visually distinct, as they will all be prefaced with `self.`. 

An exception to this: inside initializers, the backing instance variable (i.e. _variableName) should be used directly to avoid any potential side effects of the getters/setters.

Local variables should not contain underscores.

### Categories

Categories are RECOMMENDED to concisely segment functionality and should be named to describe that functionality.

**For example:**

```objc
@interface UIViewController (NYTMediaPlaying)
@interface NSString (NSStringEncodingDetection)
```

**Not:**

```objc
@interface NYTAdvertisement (private)
@interface NSString (NYTAdditions)
```

Methods and properties added in categories MUST be named with an app- or organization-specific prefix. This avoids unintentionally overriding an existing method, and it reduces the chance of two categories from different libraries adding a method of the same name. (The Objective-C runtime doesn’t specify which method will be called in the latter case, which can lead to unintended effects.)

**For example:**

```objc
@interface NSArray (NYTAccessors)
- (id)nyt_objectOrNilAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
@end
```

**Not:**

```objc
@interface NSArray (NYTAccessors)
- (id)objectOrNilAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
@end
```
